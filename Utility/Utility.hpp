/**
 * @function match_forward
 *
 * A function that very much like std::forward just forward the object passed
 * to it with the right value category as determined by the type passed to
 * match_forward.  This can be used to forward another object by considering
 * the value category of somethin different but related
 *
 * This is to be used in scenarios where you get a variable of unknown
 * referenceness and you want to forward another object, maybe related to the
 * first one with the same reference-ness as the one with unknown
 * reference-ness.  The usage for this function is illustrated below
 *
 *      template <typename Something>
 *      decltype(auto) forward_another_thing(Something&& something) {
 *          auto&& another = std::forward<Something>(something).get_another();
 *          return sharp::match_forward<Something, decltype(another)>(another);
 *      }
 *
 * With respect to the implementation of this function, there are several
 * possible cases, each corresponding to a combination of reference-ness of
 * the first template parameter of this function with that of the second,
 *
 *      TypeToMatch -> &   Type -> &
 *      TypeToMatch -> &   Type -> &&
 *      TypeToMatch -> &   Type ->
 *
 *      TypeToMatch ->     Type -> &
 *      TypeToMatch ->     Type -> &&
 *      TypeToMatch ->     Type ->
 *
 *      TypeToMatch -> &&  Type -> &
 *      TypeToMatch -> &&  Type -> &&
 *      TypeToMatch -> &&  Type ->
 *
 * Of these cases the following cases are invalid and should throw errors
 *
 *      TypeToMatch -> &   Type -> &&
 *      TypeToMatch -> &   Type ->
 *
 * Since these two cases will result in the function forwarding an lvalue as
 * an rvalue, which can lead to dangling referneces and the like.  In these
 * cases the implementation fails to compile
 *
 * In all other cases other than the error ones mentioned above, a reference
 * is returned that matches the reference-ness of the type on the left
