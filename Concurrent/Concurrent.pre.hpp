     * ReadLockTag inherits from WriteLockTag because if the implementation
     * gets a standard mutex without a lock_shared method then both the const
     * and non const versions of lock on passing both a ReadLockTag and a
     * WriteLockTag to the below functions will not get a compile error
     * because one of them will be disabled by SFINAE.
     *
     * So for example given the following case
     *
     *      Concurrent<int, std::mutex> int_locked;
     *
     *      // ... in implementation
     *      lock_mutex(int_locked.mtx, ReadLockTag{}); // (1)
     *
     * this will work even though the ReadLockTag{} dispatches the
     * implementation to the function that calls mtx.lock_shared() on the
     * underlying mutex.  This is because the std::enable_if_t disables that
     * call.  However since the ReadLockTag is inherited from WriteLockTag the
     * function call is still suitable for the write lock implementation.
     *
     * Note that sharp::preferred_dispatch is meant for a more general
     * solution to this problem, but in this case these were made before that
     * and they still serve to make the code more readable
