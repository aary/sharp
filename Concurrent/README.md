`Concurrent` Yet another concurrency abstraction
------------

`Concurrent` (originally named `ThreadSafeData`) contains an abstraction that
I implemented in my OS class that I find useful in concurrent programming.
This library tries to help you write concurrent code without some of the
drawbacks of free mutexes and condition variables.

Mutexes are logically associated with the data they protect, condition
variables are associated with the threads they block given a certain
condition.  This class tries to package both of those into one simple bite
sized concurrency primitive

This is what you would do if you wanted to have three data items that could
potentially be accessed concurrently from different threads

```c++
std::mutex mtx_one;
std::condition_variable cv_one;
std::vector<int> critical_vector;
std::mutex mtx_two
std::condition_variable cv_two;
std::deque<int> critical_deque;
std::mutex mtx_three;
std::condition_variable cv_three;
std::unordered_map<int, int> information_map;
```

This is ugly, and it is not clear which mutex is meant to protect which data
item.  Throw in some more condition variables for different conditions in
there and the code becomes chaotic, hard to read, hard to reason about and
hard to maintain

Instead you could have something like the following

```c++
sharp::Concurrent<std::vector<int>> vector;
sharp::Concurrent<std::deque<int>> deque;
sharp::Concurrent<std::unordered_map<int, int>> map;
```

This makes the semantics of the code clear and self documenting - There are
three data items that will possibly be accessed from different threads
concurrently

The API of this class makes it very hard for you to access a concurrently
accessed data item without the proper locking.

By default the mutex you use will be appropriately paired with the appropriate
data item.  And with more complicated data items you can make a struct for the
entire package
```c++
struct State {
    void foo();
    int one, two;
};
sharp::Concurrent<State> state;
```

Here it's obvious that the state will be protected by one and only one mutex
and the member methods internal to the state will not be synchronized

This avoids reliance on [compiler annotations](https://goo.gl/UW5eyi),
linters, etc.

### The interface

The simplest use case of this library is to execute code that will be
synchronized off an internal mutex associated with the data item.  This can be
done nicely with lambdas

```c++
auto vec = sharp::Concurrent<std::vector<int>>{};
auto size = vec.synchronized([](auto& vec) {
    vec.push_back(1);
    return vec.size();
});
```

This executes the size read on the vector synchronously off a mutex associated
with the vector internally.  The library manages that for you

The library also provides a simple RAII managed locking mechanism that avoids
having to rely on other external RAII wrappers like `std::unique_lock` and
`std::lock_guard` for just locking and unlocking a mutex.  The interface
handles that for you

```c++
auto lock = vec.lock();
lock->push_back(1);
for (auto integer : *lock) {
    cout << integer << endl;
}
lock.unlock();
```

This avoids the problem of having to construct RAII wrappers around mutex
classes for better more exception safe code.  There is no way to lock the
mutex without being robust in the face of exceptions

Further the library optimizes contention when the program is written in a
const correct manner.  When the concurrent object is const, a `lock()` call
tries to acquire a shared lock instead of an exclusive unique lock, this helps
increase throughput in high read scenarios for reader threads

```c++
// this acquires a shared lock on the internal mutex if possible
auto lock = sharp::as_const(data).lock();
cout << lock->size() << endl;
```

Conditional critical sections (inspired by [Google's
`absl::Mutex`](https://goo.gl/JhhGFp)) are also supported.  The interface here
tries to eliminate some of the drawbacks of condition variables (for example -
manual signalling, broadcasting, coarse lock contention on wakeups, forgetting
to signal, etc.)

```c++
// thread 1
auto lock = data.lock();
lock.wait([](auto& data) {
    return data.is_ready();
});
cout << data.get() << endl;

// thread 2
auto lock = data.lock();
lock->set_value(4);
lock.unlock();
```

Here when thread 2 is done writing and data is ready, thread 1 will be woken
up.  Simple.  No signalling.  No broadcasting.  No bugs
