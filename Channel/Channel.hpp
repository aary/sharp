/**
 * A synchronous channel that can be used for synchronization across multiple
 * threads.  This is an implementation of channels as found in the Go
 * programming langauge with an efford made to maintain the same API with the
 * expressiveness and features of C++
 *
 * A channel can be logically considered to be a n-semaphore, i.e. a semaphore
 * that can at max be incremented up to n values with the n+1th up()
 * opreration blocking until there is space in the semaphore via another
 * down() operation.  In addition channels can be used to send values across
 * along with the gating provided by semaphores.  In other words a channel is
 * an n-bounded threadsafe queue.
 *
 * Send calls on a channel block until either there is enough space in the
 * channel's buffer to accomodate another value or there is a reader waiting
 * on the other end to read the value
 *
 * Channels can also be used to stream data reactively to another thread, with
 * the API being a pair of channel iterators.  This means that the channel can
 * be used in a simple for loop
 *
 *      for (auto value : channel) {
 *          cout << value << endl;
 *      }
 *
 * The loop finishes when the other end calls close() on the channel
 *
 * Something to note here is that the channel is unlike the one in go, it is a
 * non movable non copyable entity, similar to std::mutex and
 * std::condition_variable.  However it is easy to get two seperate threads to
 * operate on the same channel without having to worry that much about
 * lifetime by wrapping the channel in a shared_ptr, for example
 *
 *      auto channel = std::make_shared<Channel<int>>(1);
 *
 *      auto th_one = std::thread{[channel]() {
 *          // this send will not block as the channel has room for one
 *          // element in its internal buffer
 *          channel.send(1);
 *      }};
 *      auto th_two = std::thread{[channel]() {
 *          // this read will block until the channel has a value
 *          cout << channel.read() << endl;
 *      }};
 *
 * Further the behavior of the channel can be customized to fit thread
 * implementations by changing the mutex and condition variable type
 *
 * Channels also capture the value or error semantics of Go channels by
 * providing methods to send exceptions across channels, for example
 *
 *      channel.send_exception(exception_ptr);
 *
 *      try {
 *          channel.read();
 *      } catch(std::exception& exc) {
 *          cerr << exc.what() << endl;
 *      }
 *
 * If exceptions are common and erroneous conditions are to be expected then
 * you can avoid costly rethrows by calling Channel::read_try().  This will
 * return a sharp::Try object.  sharp::Try logically models either a value,
 * an exception or nothing at all, kind of like an optional with another state
 * to store exceptions.  This can therefore be used to manually check for
 * errors.  Hopefully there is a feature in the C++ library to allow
 * visitation on exceptions ith RAII and generalized overloading.  If done,
 * then this can be used to visit exception pointers in an efficient way.  See
 * sharp::visit to get an idea of what this might look like
 *
 *      auto try = channel.read_try();
 *      if (try.has_value()) {
 *          cout << *try << endl;
 *      } else {
 *          cout << "Channel read returned an error" << endl;
 *      }
 *
 * Select statements are also supported, see the documentation above the
 * select() function below for more information about its semantics and usage
 * but for a quick example
 *
 *      sharp::select(
 *          sharp::make_case(channel_one, []() -> int {
 *              return 1;
 *          }),
 *          sharp::make_case(channel_two, [](auto value) {
 *              cout << "Read value " << value << endl;
 *          })
 *      );
 *
 * Where a write from the channel is modelled by a callable that returns a
 * value and a read is modeled by a callable that accepts a single value
