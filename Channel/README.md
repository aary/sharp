`Channel`
---------

An implementation of channels as found in the [Go programming
langauge](https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/2)

## Design decisions

- The interface of channels in Go has been mimicked as much as possible, while
  trying to retain the idiomatic C++ representation of each operation.  For
  example the [`select()`](https://goo.gl/DVQtEh) statement has been designed
  to feel familiar to Go users, while utilizing C++ features to work as
  efficiently as possible

- This library does not make any assumptions about the programming model of the
  user's code.  For example if the goal is shared dynamic ownership then
  simply dump the channels into `std::shared_ptr` instances

- C++ has RAII and exceptions.  As a consequence these channels do not support
  the more primitive form of error passing through values, but rather have
  utilities to send exceptions, see the
  [`send_exception`](https://goo.gl/Dx8T4U) method

- Unlike other implementations, this implementation does not have the buffer
  size set at compile time.  This allows users to control the asynchronoicity
  of APIs and also allows them to engineer code which is independent of the
  buffer size into a compiled form.  Such a design allows users to
  interoperate with libraries that use channels for synchronization with their
  own channel instances

## Example usage

```c++
#include <numeric>
#include <thread>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

#include <sharp/Channel/Channel.hpp>

using std::cout;
using std::endl;

template <typename InputIt>
void sum(InputIt begin, InputIt end, sharp::Channel<int>& c) {
    auto sum = std::accumulate(begin, end, 0);
    c.send(sum);
}

int main() {

    auto s = std::vector<int>{7, 2, 8, -9, 4, 0};

    sharp::Channel<int> c;
    std::thread{[&]() { sum(s.begin(), s.begin() + s.size()/2, c); }}.detach();
    std::thread{[&]() { sum(s.begin() + s.size()/2, s.end(), c); }}.detach();

    auto x = c.read();
    auto y = c.read();

    cout << x << y << x + y << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Buffered channels

```c++
#include <iostream>

#include <sharp/Channel/Channel.hpp>

using std::cout;
using std::endl;

int main() {
    sharp::Channel<int> c{2};
    ch.send(1);
    ch.send(2);
    cout << ch.read() << endl;
    cout << ch.read() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```


### Range based channeling

```c++
#include <sharp/Channel/Channel.hpp>
#include <sharp/Range/Range.hpp>

void fibonacci(sharp::Channel<int>& c) {
    auto x = 0, y = 1;

    for (auto i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {

        auto to_send = x, new_y = x + y;
        x = y;
        y = new_y;

        c.send(to_send);
    }

    c.close();
}

int main() {

    sharp::Channel<int> c;
    std::thread{[&]() { fibonacci(c); }}.detach();

    for (auto i : c) {
        cout < i << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```


### Compile time channel multiplexing via `select`
The compile time `select` API implementation picks whether you are waiting on
a read or a write based on the signature of the function passed in along with
the channel.

```c++
#include <iostream>

#include <sharp/Channel/Channel.hpp>

using std::cout;

void fibonacci(sharp::Channel<int>& c, sharp::Channel<int>& quit) {
    auto x = 0, y = 1;

    auto should_continue = true;
    while (should_continue) {

        sharp::select(
            sharp::make_case(c, [&]() -> int {
                auto to_send = x, new_y = x + y;
                x = y;
                y = new_y;

                return to_send;
            }),

            sharp::make_case(quit, [&](auto) {
                cout << "Quitting" << endl;
                should_continue = false;
            })
        );
    }
}

int main() {
    sharp::Channel<int> c;
    sharp::Channel<int> quit;

    std::thread{[&]() {

        for (auto i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
            cout << c.read() << endl;
        }
        quit.send(0);
    }}.detach();

    fibonacci(c, quit);
}
```
