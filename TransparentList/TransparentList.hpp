 *
 * A simple free linked list that does not offer any memory abstractions.  As
 * such the linked list class does not hook into any memory abstractions such
 * as allocators as well.  Resulting in convenience for situations where the
 * program is written right on top of an existing memory model with no
 * intermediate abstractions such as some embedded systems, kernel level
 * programming and library implementations such as malloc.  Good C++
 * abstractions are usually not available in these cases, and the result is
 * often bad code which could be more idiomatic
 *
 * Since it can be used for pretty much any purpose and uses pointers, the
 * linked list asserts alignment on the largest boundary of primitive types to
 * ensure correctness (invalid alignment on some architectures eg.  ARM causes
 * a fault) and maximum performance (x86 ignores unaligned accesses at the
 * cost of runtime).
